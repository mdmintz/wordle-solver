If you're looking for a complete Python Selenium solution for solving the [Wordle Game](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) programmatically, here's one that uses the [SeleniumBase](https://github.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase) framework. The solution comes with a [YouTube video](https://youtube.com/watch?v=wSvehy4u_xw), as well as [the Python code of the solution](https://github.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase/blob/master/examples/wordle_test.py), and a GIF of what to expect:

Note that SeleniumBase tests are run using ``pytest``.

Have fun solving "Wordle" with SeleniumBase using Python and Selenium!
